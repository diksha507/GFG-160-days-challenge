Spirally traversing a matrix

You are given a rectangular matrix mat[][] of size n x m, and your task is to return an array while traversing the matrix in spiral form.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10]
