Given an array of integers arr[] in a circular fashion. Find the maximum subarray sum that we can get if we assume the array to be circular.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [8, -8, 9, -9, 10, -11, 12]
Output: 22
Explanation: Starting from the last element of the array, i.e, 12, and moving in a circular fashion, we have max subarray as 12, 8, -8, 9, -9, 10, which gives maximum sum as 22.
